/**
 * This file was created by P. Laforet on 2/21/17
 *
 * This file is a "bare bones" template that contains the specific setting for our robot. We use a type of
 * Holonomic drive we call a CrabBot, Where the FrontLeft, FrontRight, BackLeft, and BackRight motors all
 * use Omniwheels, and there is a CenterMotor, also with an Omniwheel, that runs perpendicular to the other
 * motors. This allows the robot to be controlled with standard Tank Drive but allows it to strafe side to
 * side easily.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into the same folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
